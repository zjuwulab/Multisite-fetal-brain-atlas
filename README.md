_1.5T atlas_ [23w-36w]: constructed using healthy fetal brain T2w images scanned at **1.5T** scanner (clinical data)\
_3T 4mm atlas_ [23w-38w]: constructed using healthy fetal brain T2w images scanned at **3T** scanner with **4mm** slice thickness (clinical data)\
_3T 2mm atlas_ [23w-38w]: constructed using healthy fetal brain T2w images scanned at **3T** scanner with **2mm** slice thickness (research data)
